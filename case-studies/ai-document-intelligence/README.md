# AI-Powered Document Intelligence for Insurance & Compliance  
### Cutting Document Review Time from Minutes to Seconds

This case study explains how BIS Advisors designed and deployed an AI-powered 
document intelligence system that dramatically reduces the time required to 
interpret long, dense, and cross-referenced documents such as:

- Insurance policies (cyber, property, liability, ESG)
- SOC 2 Type I/II reports
- NIST 800-53 and 800-171 frameworks
- Cyber endorsements, exclusions, and regulatory guidance
- Audit evidence and compliance documentation

The system consistently delivers:

- **80–90% reduction in document lookup time**  
- **2–7 second grounded, citation-backed answers**  
- **Low-to-mid 90% accuracy**  
- **Hybrid deployment across on-prem RTX 4090 and GCP L4**  
- **Predictable, low compute costs per question**
